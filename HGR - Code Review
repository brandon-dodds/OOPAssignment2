Program.cs:
	Error checking is flawed:
	if user provides no files arguments then an exception is thrown at line 22
	if user enters a filename with spaces at the start, or end, of the filename these are not trimmed and an exception is thrown at line 19
	user input is not casted to lower, so commands entered in uppercase format, or with spaces, do not get caught in the switch case at line 18
	If the files are renamed from .txt to another format, the hash check throws the incorrect result, and says it's the same as the initial file.
	\n is used instead of Environment.Newline. This is bad practise for cross-platform coding.
HashResult.cs:
	var is used where it is not clear what the return value is.
	Hashresult class should be static, as there is nothing to instantiate
Output.cs:
	Output class should be static, as there is nothing to instantiate
	HelpOutput could use lamba.
Docstrings are not used.
