Comments:
Commenting is clear and used effectively throughout.

Error Handling:
Good use of switch cases to provide user with error message if input is not valid.
Use of try catch to handle file not found exception and provides error message for each file which is great. 
Could maybe add what exception is being caught in the error message. 
Errors occur if extra spaces are added within the user input between file name.
Errors occur if upper case letters are used.

Suggestions for improvement:
Provides user with a help section, with name of text files, if the user input is incorrect. 
Variables are appropriately named.  
Doesn't allow the user to stop running the program, just continues to loop so could provide an option to allow the user to exit once finished.
Code has good functionality and does what the task asks for, however some code may not be needed as not asked for.
